Read: Class 15 - Diversity and Inclusion

I really enjoyed these readings as well as the presentation from Brooke today. I think that the push for diversity and inclusion in the tech industry is so important and I’m glad that it is such a hot topic in today’s world. We need more representation of minorities and women in the tech industry and in places that decisions are made. Diverse groups of people bring different ways of seeing a problem and in turn, faster/better ways of solving problems. A more diverse group of people offer smarter and more creative ways of thinking. We need to be open to the idea of hearing other people's points of views and also remembering to help lift up others to hear minorities' points of views. I want to help bring awareness and if there is any way that I can use a platform that I have to magnify minorities voices, then I want to do that any way I can.
