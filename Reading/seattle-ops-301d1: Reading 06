Today's reading was all about the Microsoft Active Directory, which can be refered by MAD, or more commonly AD. The Microsoft Active Directory is a working database of all network and is an authoratative place that controls access and stores data. The four structual elements of the AD system are 1. Objects 2. Domain 3. Trees 4. Forest.  Objests make the bottom of the elements and it is the most grannular, and work all the way up. Domain is the next up, and when you have muliple domains, that makes a tree. When you have mulitple trees that makes up a forest. Forest is the biggest picture of the four structual elements of the Active Directory.
