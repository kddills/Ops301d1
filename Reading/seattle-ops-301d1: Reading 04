VPN is short for Virtual Private Networks, and they used a process called tunneling to extend a private network across a public network. Tunneling is a process that encrypts data and keeps it separate from other traffic on the internet. It enable to protect the confidentiality, your data remains private and the data also remains unaltered. Tunneling works by protecting data by repackaging it into a different form. Even though in real life, no tunnel actually exists, the data has to travel through the same wires as any other data passing through the public network. VPM tunneling employes the concepts known as date encapsulation and encryption to safety carry data traffic through the non secure environment. Encapsulation insulated the packet of date from other data that is traveling over the same network, while encryption makes the other data invisible and unreadable to surveillance agents and even criminals.
