Readings: Azure Cloud Administration

Microsoft Azure which used to be known as Windows Azure is a cloud computing service that competes with other services from Amazon and Google. Cloud computing is often thought of as where you store your data on a remote server somewhere else. Companies take advantage of these services so they donâ€™t have to purchase hardware upfront, and when the more is needed then all they have to do is purchase and when less is used then the amount is adjusted for how much is used. The cloud shares the hardware and it automatically assigns the work as necessary. You only pay for the resources as you need them. Azure provides a directory of different services you can use, full virtual machines, databases, file storage and backups.
